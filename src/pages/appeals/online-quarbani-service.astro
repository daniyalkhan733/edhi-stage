          </h2>

          <p class="text-[17px] font-roboto">
            Qurbani is a sacrifice that is offered at the time of Eid al-Adha to show gratitude towards Allah (swt) and to provide for the poor and needy. The Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.W) was once asked by his Companions: “O Prophet of Allah! What is this qurbani?” He replied, “It is the Sunnah of your father Ibrahim (A.S).”

          </p>
          <p class="text-[17px]">
            (Hadith – Ibn Majah) Allah (swt) says in the Qur’an: “It is neither their flesh nor their blood that reaches Allah; it is your piety that reaches Him.” (Qur’an 22:37) Qurbani has been performed from the time of Ibrahim (as) and commemorates also Ibrahim’s willingness to sacrifice his son, who was replaced by an animal at the time of sacrifice.

          Qurbani Eid, also known as Eid al-Adha, happens after the yearly Hajj pilgrimage. The date of Eid al-Adha, the 10th day of Dhul Hijjah, can vary, and celebrations typically last for two to four days, depending on the country. During these days, families and communities come together to mark the occasion. <br><br>The highlight of Qurbani Eid is the Qurbani, which means sacrifice. This special act is carried out right after the Eid prayers, where people gather to perform their prayers in unity.

<br><br>Eid al-Adha holds great importance in Islam, symbolizing obedience, gratitude, and compassion. It's a time for communal prayers, sharing meals, and expressing generosity by distributing the Qurbani meat among family, friends, and those in need. The festive atmosphere brings joy and unity, emphasizing the values of togetherness and compassion during this auspicious occasion.
<br><br>It is a significant moment that reflects the spirit of sacrifice and giving, mirroring the story of Prophet Ibrahim.
