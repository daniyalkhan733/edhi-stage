              Aqeeqa is an Islamic tradition performed to express gratitude for a newborn child. It involves slaughtering sheep or goats and is carried out shortly after a child's birth as a symbol of the child's dedication to Islam. This practice not only fulfills a religious obligation but also allows families to share their happiness by distributing meat to the needy, celebrating new life by spreading generosity and community spirit.

            Aqeeqa is deeply rooted in Islamic tradition, serving as a beautiful ritual that marks the entrance of a child into the Muslim faith. It symbolizes the parents' gratitude towards Allah for the blessing of a child and is seen as a way to safeguard the newborn against misfortune. By performing Aqeeqa, parents show their readiness to raise their child according to Islamic principles and teachings. <br /><br />
            This ceremony involves slaughtering one or two sheep or goats, depending on the gender of the child—two for a boy and one for a girl. The meat from the sacrifice is then distributed among family, friends, and especially to those in need. This act of giving not only fulfills a religious duty but also reinforces the ties of kinship and community. It is recommended to hold the Aqeeqa on the seventh day after the child's birth, but it can be performed later if necessary. 
            <br />

        <div class="w-full md:w-1/2 md:pl-4">
          <h5 class="text-green-700 font-bold text-justify pb-2">
            The Prophet (saw) said that 'Aqiqa is to be offered for a (newly born) boy, so slaughter (an animal) for him, and relieve him of his suffering. (Sahih Bukhari) 
          </h5>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-justify text-[17px] font-roboto">
            Furthermore, Aqeeqa is a chance for the community to celebrate together. It's traditional to invite family, friends, and neighbors to share a meal, promoting unity and happiness. This event also publicly welcomes the child into the Muslim community, highlighting the support they'll receive throughout their life. <br /><br />
            Aqeeqa also showcases charity and generosity. Distributing meat to the needy demonstrates Islamic values of compassion and caring. It teaches everyone, especially young children, about the importance of giving, instilling lifelong values of generosity and community spirit. Through Aqeeqa, parents exemplify faith and community engagement for their children.

                While the Aqeeqa can be performed on any day, it is traditionally carried out on the 7th, 14th, or 21st day after the birth of the child. The Edhi Foundation can accommodate the preferred date of the family as long as it is communicated in advance.
