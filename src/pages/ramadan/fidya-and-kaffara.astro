      “Fasting is for a fixed number of days, and if one of you be sick, or if one of you be on a journey, you will fast the same number of other days later on. For those who are capable of fasting (but still do not fast), there is a redemption: feeding a needy man for each day missed. Whoever voluntarily does more good than is required, will find it better for him; and that you should fast is better for you, if you only know.” (Holy Qur’an 2: 184)

              Fidya and Kaffarah offer a meaningful way to support those in need during the blessed month of
               Ramadan. For individuals unable to fast due to illness, old age, or other valid reasons, Fidya 
               provides a way to fulfill their religious duty by donating to feed the less fortunate. On the
                other hand, Kaffarah is required when 
              <br /><br />
              someone deliberately breaks their fast without a valid excuse. It involves either fasting
              for 60 consecutive days or feeding 60 needy individuals.Both Fidya and Kaffarah are powerful
              acts of charity that help relieve hunger and bring spiritual rewards. By giving Fidya for
              missed fasts or Kaffarah, you are making a tangible difference in the lives of those who 
              struggle to access food. Your donations provide essential sustenance to individuals who 
              may otherwise go hungry, offering them hope and comfort during Ramadan.
