              Ramadan 2025 is a sacred month for Muslims around the world,
              filled with spiritual reflection, self-discipline, and community
              solidarity. During this blessed month, Muslims fast from dawn to
              sunset, refraining from food and drink as a way to purify the soul
              and strengthen their connection to Allah. But most of the muslims
              across the UK and the globe can't break the fast and face food
              insecurity. Ramadan is not just about abstaining from worldly
              pleasures, but also about growing in empathy and compassion for
              those in need. That's Why Edhi foundation Iftar Food pack appeal
              steps in.

            <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed font-roboto mt-6">
              Every Ramadan, over 600 million people face food insecurity during
              iftar times, including children in the UK who have lost their
              parents and struggle to survive without proper nutrition in iftar.
              Hunger not only affects their health but also makes it difficult
              for them to focus on their daily needs in ramadan.
              <br /><br />
              Through our iftar Pack Appeal to feed the fasting this Ramadan 2025,
              we provide essential food supplies and proper nutritious iftar packs
              to families in need, ensuring they can begin and break their fast with
              dignity and joy with our iftar donation appeal.
