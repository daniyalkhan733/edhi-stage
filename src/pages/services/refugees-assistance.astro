          For refugees who have endured trauma and displacement, the emotional toll can be overwhelming. Edhi Foundation recognizes the importance of addressing the mental health needs of refugees and provides a range of psychosocial support services to assist them in coping with their challenges. These services include individual counseling sessions where refugees can express their feelings and concerns in a safe and supportive environment. <br /><br />In addition to individual counseling, Edhi Foundation organizes support groups where refugees can connect with others who have experienced similar struggles. These groups offer a sense of belonging and solidarity, allowing refugees to share their stories, offer mutual support, and learn coping strategies from one another. By fostering a sense of community and camaraderie, these support groups help refugees feel less isolated and alone in their journey. <br /><br
          />
          Furthermore, Edhi Foundation implements other interventions aimed at promoting resilience and well-being among refugees. This may include providing educational workshops on stress management techniques, relaxation exercises, and mindfulness practices.  <br /><br />
          By equipping refugees with practical tools and strategies to navigate their emotional challenges, the Foundation empowers them to build inner strength and resilience in the face of adversity.
