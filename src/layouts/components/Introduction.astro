                Born in 1928 in the small village of Bantva near Joona Garh, Gujrat (India), Abdul Sattar Edhi's journey of compassion began with the seeds planted in his soul during his mother's illness. At the age of eleven, when his mother became paralyzed and later suffered from mental illness, Edhi devoted himself to her care.

                He undertook the responsibilities of cleaning, bathing, changing clothes, and feeding her. Despite his efforts, the battle against the disease proved to be challenging, and his mother's helplessness grew over the years. This early experience shaped Edhi's lifelong commitment to alleviating the suffering of humanity.
